# Book Swap
  A platform used to exchange books, sell or buy in an easy way and fast one. You can search 
  for books then contact the user via Whatsapp. The projects goal for me is to make my school
  have a way for students and my friends to exchange old books in a safe way due to Corona
  Virus. The project was fully functional but it wasn't used because no one wanted to hear 
  my idea in the adminstration :(
